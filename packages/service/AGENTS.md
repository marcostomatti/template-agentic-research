# AGENTS — template-service-express

Standalone Express + MCP service template. Single package, bun-first, no
workspace. Read this before changing anything; the per-area conventions live
in `.claude/skills/` and are pointed to below.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/` | The framework: `express` (createService: DI, middleware, health, `/_control`, auth middleware, shutdown), `service-core` (dependencies, typed clients, circuit breaker, retry, http client), `mcp` (createMCP: stdio/HTTP transports + health), `logger` (pino), `errors` (AppError family + the error handler createService registers). Treat as library code — stable, well-tested, changed deliberately. |
| `src/` | The service: `config.ts` (zod env, fail-fast), `routes/`, `db/` (Drizzle+Postgres, default on), `redis/` (opt-in via `REDIS_URL`), `cron/` (interval jobs as a managed dependency), `notifications/` (preference-aware dispatch + channel stubs), `auth/` (dev introspection stub), `mcp/` (MCP entry + tools). |
| `tools/ralph/` (umbrella root) | The agent task loop: `plan` (spec → PLAN/PREREQUISITES), `start` (tracker loop, `--plan`, `--start-at`), `usage`. |
| `tests/` | Cross-cutting tests; `tests/live/` is the live suite (see Testing). Package-level tests are colocated (`lib/**/__tests__`, `src/**/*.test.ts`). |
| `specs/` | TRACKED follow-up specs + index (`specs/README.md`) — only for work whose subject is already visible in the code (refactors, hardening of published code, tooling). |
| `.specs/`, `.plans/` | UNTRACKED (gitignored) working areas — see "Plans and specs" below. |
| `docs/` | Tracked guides (drizzle, rpc, sse). Generated output goes to gitignored `.docs/` (`bun run docs:generate`). |

## Research pipeline

This package is where the research pipeline lands, and its design is
written down rather than inferred:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — the index of the architecture doc set; read it
  first.
- `docs/architecture/00-overview.md` — the platform shape (Postgres as
  the only source of truth, n8n as the pipeline executor, this service
  as the API over the same schema), the layout map, the core
  vocabulary, which document covers each behaviour area, and the test
  harness.
- `docs/architecture/01-invariants.md` — the register of platform-wide
  invariants: what each one is, the artifact that fails when it stops
  holding, the phase that lands that artifact, and its status today.
- `.specs/2026-08-19-research-pipeline-port.md` — the approved parent
  design the port runs from, in seven phases. Untracked on purpose
  (see "Plans and specs" below), so it sits on the machine doing the
  work rather than in a clone.

Two rules bind every phase of that port:

- **Same-commit doc-update law**: a commit that changes behaviour in a
  row of the mapping table in `docs/architecture/00-overview.md` updates
  that row's document in the same commit, and behaviour no row covers
  adds a row.
- **Naming invariant**: no naming from the project this pipeline was
  ported from, no vault path, and no real hostname appears in the
  package's scanned source — `tests/invariants/naming.test.ts` fails
  naming the file and line of every hit.

## Conventions

- **Env**: all configuration through `src/config.ts` — zod-validated at
  import, `import process from 'node:process'` (bare `process` fails lint).
- **Dependencies**: anything with a lifecycle (db, redis, cron, future
  queues) is a `createDependency` passed to `createService({ dependencies })`
  — started in order, stopped in reverse, visible to `/_control`.
- **Errors**: throw `AppError` subclasses (`lib/errors`) or let Zod errors
  bubble — the registered handler maps them to typed JSON responses. Express
  4 does NOT auto-forward async route errors: wrap async handlers in
  try/catch + `next(err)` (see `src/index.ts` `/users`).
- **Routes**: validate input at the boundary with zod (see the `api` skill).
- **Docs**: TSDoc on exported surfaces; see the `documentation` skill.

## Verification order

```bash
bun run lint && bun run check-types && bun run test
```

All three must be green before a PR. `check-types` currently excludes
`**/*.test.ts` (origin parity — see `specs/test-type-checking.md`).

## Testing — isolated vs live (CRITICAL)

The default suite is FULLY ISOLATED: no db, no network, no credentials.
Keep it that way — a past incident where tests ran against live
infrastructure with real credentials burned a month of tokens in under an
hour. The rules:

1. New tests mock or fake external systems by default. If a fake gets
   nontrivial, give the fake its own contract tests.
2. Live tests go in `tests/live/*.live.test.ts`, gated through
   `describeLivePg` (env-var opt-in → `describe.skip` otherwise; keep the
   explicit type annotation — inference breaks `tsc` with TS2742).
3. Live tests run only against the `--profile stress` compose services
   (`bun run stress:start / test:live / stress:stop`) — separate port,
   separate database name, no volume.
4. Destructive helpers must call `assertLiveDatabase` (refuses any database
   but `ar_live`). Never widen the truncate list implicitly.
5. Clean up after live runs: `stress:stop` removes only the stress
   containers. Leave no long-lived processes or scheduled jobs behind.
6. `fileParallelism: false` lives in `vitest.config.ts`, not on a script
   flag, so exported env vars can't re-parallelize the live files.

## Plans and specs

`.plans/` and `.specs/` are the destinations for working plans and specs,
and they are **gitignored on purpose**: these files routinely describe
critical bugs (privacy/security) before they are patched, and must never
reach the remote ahead of the fix. Rules:

- Generated plan artifacts (`PLAN-<stub>.md`, `PREREQUISITES-<stub>.md`,
  `PLAN_TRACKER-<stub>.md`) live in `.plans/` — `ralph plan` writes there,
  and the loop's commit step can then never pick them up by accident.
- Specs you are actively working from go in `.specs/`. The tracked `specs/`
  directory is only for follow-ups whose subject is already visible in the
  public code (e.g. hardening notes on shipped modules); when in doubt,
  `.specs/`.
- Never "tidy" these files into a tracked path, and never weaken the
  `.gitignore` entries.

## The loop

`bun run ralph plan --spec=<specs|.specs>/<file>.md` writes
`.plans/PLAN-<stub>.md` (+ `.plans/PREREQUISITES-<stub>.md` when needed) per
the `dev-planner` skill; when a `progress.txt` exists, its findings are
injected as advisory planning context (skip with `--no-progress`).
`bun run ralph start --plan=.plans/PLAN-<stub>.md` executes it task-by-task
with a per-plan tracker, marking `[x]`/`[BLOCKED]` and resuming blocked
tasks first. `--start-at=HH:MM` defers a run. On completion the loop
promotes general findings from `progress.txt` into the repo docs/skills and
then compacts the file per `.claude/skills/progress-hygiene/SKILL.md` —
progress feeds future plan generation, so it must stay small and current.

## Issue reporting

The `qa-bug-reporter` agent files findings as GitHub issues via `gh`
(dedupes first, never guesses priority, asks before filing). Security
findings are routed to a private security advisory by a human — never to the
public tracker, and never searched for on it first.

## Workflow

Feature-branch → PR → merge. `test.yml` gates PRs with the isolated suite
only. Integration/live testing is a local (or self-hosted-runner) concern by
design.
