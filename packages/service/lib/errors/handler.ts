/**
 * Converts a `ZodError` into a `ValidationError` with structured `FieldError[]` details.
 * Each Zod issue's `path` is joined with `.` to produce dot-notation field names
 * (e.g. `"user.email"`). Top-level fields produce a name without a dot.
 *
 * `issue.message` is copied VERBATIM; nothing here composes or rewords it.
 * `errorHandler` answers a `ZodError` with `res.status(422).json(...)` over
 * this error's `toJSON()`, and `toJSON()` spreads `details`, so zod's own
 * wording is what an API consumer reads in the 422 body. A zod major that
 * rewords an issue therefore changes this service's public error text with
 * no diff in this file, and neither the type system nor the hand-built
 * issue fixtures can see it: the zod 3-to-4 bump turned `Required` into
 * `Invalid input: expected string, received undefined`.
 *
 * The characterization block in `__tests__/handler.test.ts` is the guard.
 * It pins the exact strings against a REAL failing `safeParse`, so a
 * reword arrives as one red case rather than as a silent change on the
 * wire.
 *
 * @param err - The `ZodError` to convert.
 * @returns A `ValidationError` ready to be thrown or returned.

/**
 * Factory that returns an Express 4-argument error-handling middleware.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 * - `ZodError` → delegates to `zodToValidationError`, responds 422 with `VALIDATION_ERROR`.
 * - `AppError` subclass → logs with `warn`, responds with the error's own `statusCode` and `toJSON()` body.
 * - Unknown `Error` or thrown value → logs with `error` (including `errorName`/`code`/`reason` when present), responds 500 with `{ code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR', message: 'An unexpected error occurred' }`.
 *
 * The response is unconditional for EVERY branch above — even if reading a
 * logged field or the logging call itself throws, that failure is caught so
 * the branch's response still goes out with the same body it would have sent
 * had logging succeeded.
 *
 * **Note:** This handler is registered automatically by `createService` in
 * `lib/express`. Do **not** add it manually inside a service's
 * `register()` function, or it will be mounted twice.
 *
 * @param logger - A logger instance with `warn` and `error` methods.
 * @returns An Express `ErrorRequestHandler` to be passed to `app.use()`.
