# agentic-research

Umbrella monorepo (bun workspaces) for the agentic research platform: research
one or more domains under a shallow taxonomy, produce periodic digests, and
expose/export results over multiple formats/protocols (MCP, Markdown, RSS, …).

## Workspace map

| Path | Package | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/ui` | `@ar/ui` | Component library (CVA + Tailwind 4 + Radix), Storybook workbench, visual regression harness. Vendored fork of the `components-library` template. |
| `packages/web` | `@ar/web` | The web app (Vite + React 19), consumes `@ar/ui`. Shell scaffold today; pages arrive per the UI spec. |
| `packages/service` | `@ar/service` | Express + MCP service (drizzle/Postgres), vendored fork of the `template-service-express` template. Future home of the research pipeline stack (workflows, sources, exports). |
| `tools/ralph` | — | The agent task loop (`bun run ralph plan|start|usage` from the repo root). Plans/trackers live in `.plans/`. |

Each package keeps its own `AGENTS.md` with package-specific conventions —
read it before working inside that package. Both vendored packages are
**fork-style copies** of their template repos: no automated sync; a change
wanted in both places must be made in both repos.

## Shared tooling

- `eslint.base.mjs` + `sharedRules.mjs` at the root; each package (and the
  root) layers its own leaf `eslint.config.mjs` on top.
- `tsconfig.base.json` is the shared strict core; leaves specialize
  (DOM/react-jsx for ui/web, node-strict for service, root covers `tools/`).
- Root scripts: `lint:all`, `check-types:all`, `test:all` fan out to every
  package; bare `lint`/`check-types`/`test` cover root files + `tools/`.
- Runtime: bun-first (`packageManager` pinned). `@ar/ui`'s test toolchain
  additionally needs Node 22 on PATH (`bun x` shebang handling).

## Plans and specs (CRITICAL)

Working plans and specs go in `.plans/` and `.specs/` at the repo root —
both **gitignored on purpose**: these files routinely describe critical
bugs (privacy/security) before they are patched, and must never reach the
remote ahead of the fix. Never "tidy" them into a tracked path, and never
weaken the `.gitignore` entries. Tracked docs are only for material whose
subject is already visible in the public code; when in doubt, `.specs/`.

## Security posture (carried from the templates, incident-derived)

- Isolated vs live test split is structural: the default suite touches no
  external service; the live suite self-skips without `AR_LIVE_DATABASE_URL`,
  runs only against the no-volume `ar_live` DB on port 5433, and its
  destructive helpers refuse any other database name.
- Security findings route to a private advisory, never a public tracker —
  and are never searched for on a public tracker first (see the
  `qa-bug-reporter` agent).
- No `@open-tomato/*` imports anywhere (ESLint-enforced). Origin prose only
  in README/NOTICE.

## Verification order

1. `bun run lint:all` — zero problems.
2. `bun run check-types:all` — clean.
3. `bun run test:all` — root (ralph) + every package's default suite.
4. UI work additionally follows `packages/ui/AGENTS.md` (visual baselines
   FIRST, then the rest — baselines are per-environment, regenerate, never
   copy).

## Workflow

Feature-branch → PR → merge. Conventional commit types (feat, fix, refactor,
docs, test, chore, perf, ci). Run the verification order before any PR.
